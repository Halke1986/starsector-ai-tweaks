SUGGESTED: ships avoid collisions with very large modded shields

----------------------------------------------------------------

- attack enemy ships that are inflicting damage

- sometimes guided finisher missiles are ignored when venting, especially on phase ships

- ships with assignment should have priority, at least for player fleet.

- area targeting for devastator

- do not track targets with angular velocity higher than weapon rotation

- avoid blocking burn vector via collision avoidance

- revisit hiding behind allies to vent

- extract vanilla missile decisioning

- take damage type into account when calculating history of calculated damage, to not ignore hellbores when venting

- aim slow turrets
- DEPRECATED: use front facing turrets with rotation speed lower than ship turn rate as hardpoints
- unless flamed out
- not for player

- try to attack same enemy battle group during initial split

- notify systems of overridden facing in extended AI

check Lidar on faster ships - destroyer : ass pinetree, frigate DEX Catapult

- why SO ships backing off so far away
- nova backing off too far to vent
    - probably missileDangerDir

- Unify "$\ " keys!

disable staggered fire through a config file

Yes, so I'm talking about all kinetic energy weapons and special ships that cannot be locked by these two shield
modules. After turning off that setting, pinning the shieldless ship like the fortress can be attacked normally, but it
has no effect on these two bodies. Shield, but ships with shields with hidden modules will still make mistakes
Guess it might be the problem AI Revised AI Tweaks 1.12.4 ai wants to judge the opposite module shield, but because it
cannot be locked, it cannot be judged, resulting in a direct dull fire

- In the original post, the mod referenced as “ghost troops” is written as 幽灵部队 (with “戒灵” being a ship name from
  that mod), and the one referred to as “Big rice dumplings” is written as 大粽子 (preceded by “fsf的壁垒盾” in the
  text).

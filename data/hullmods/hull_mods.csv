Under the Protocol, the modified weapons are inhibited from firing at shields. This allows to reliably hit exposed hull surfaces the moment the shields drop and to conserve flux capacity.

Affected weapons are burst beams like %s and %s, as well as High Explosive beams like %s.

The Protocol is active only for weapons in %s mode and does not affect point defense beams.",,,,,,graphics/hullmods/finisher_beam_protocol.png

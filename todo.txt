SUGGESTED: ships avoid collisions with very large modded shields

----------------------------------------------------------------

- attack enemy ships that are inflicting damage

- sometimes guided finisher missiles are ignored when venting, especially on phase ships

- ships with assignment should have priority, at least for player fleet.

- area targeting for devastator

- don't prevent venting if target has more health than the ship

- REPORTED: vanilla ai fleets gathering in the middle of the map, on maps with no objectives

- do not track targets with angular velocity higher than weapon rotation

- avoid blocking burn vector via collision avoidance

- revisit hiding behind allies to vent

- extract vanilla missile decisioning

- drop the "frame-perfect" description from readme

- take damage type into account when calculating history of calculated damage, to not ignore hellbores when venting

SUGGESTED/REPORTED: For the Custom AI it will start venting immediately when using a long ranged weapon that fires volleys, cutting off the
volley prematurely.  This is best shown with Domain Phase Lab's Acuity ships with their Note launchers.
A request, since this might just be vanilla behavior, but I'd try tweaking the Omnishield settings to heavily
deprioritize shielding towards friendly ships that are nearby.  Often, this behavior happens even if there's a much
larger ship nearby actively unloading it's entire arsenal onto a ship and they're worried about scratching the paint on
another ship.

- aim slow turrets
- DEPRECATED: use front facing turrets with rotation speed lower than ship turn rate as hardpoints
 - unless flamed out
 - not for player

- try to attack same enemy battle group during initial split

- fleet coord seems to leave no place for ships sometimes, observed with erads

REPORTED: Yeah, I console command in 2 lg sunder to test and I canâ€™t equip the other one [with custom AI]

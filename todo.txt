SUGGESTED: ships avoid collisions with very large modded shields

----------------------------------------------------------------

- attack enemy ships that are inflicting damage

- sometimes guided finisher missiles are ignored when venting, especially on phase ships

- ships with assignment should have priority, at least for player fleet.

- area targeting for devastator

- REPORTED: vanilla ai fleets gathering in the middle of the map, on maps with no objectives

- do not track targets with angular velocity higher than weapon rotation

- avoid blocking burn vector via collision avoidance

- revisit hiding behind allies to vent

- extract vanilla missile decisioning

- drop the "frame-perfect" description from readme

- take damage type into account when calculating history of calculated damage, to not ignore hellbores when venting

- aim slow turrets
- DEPRECATED: use front facing turrets with rotation speed lower than ship turn rate as hardpoints
 - unless flamed out
 - not for player

- try to attack same enemy battle group during initial split

- fleet coord seems to leave no place for ships sometimes, observed with erads

SUGGESTED by Roxorium: Speaking of which, @Genir would it be possible to add "ignore wrecks and asteroids" toggle?

SUGGESTED by vinh: Oh btw genir, remember the not making needlee firing againdt hull feature? Can you make it so that minipulse and vpd also do this?

SUGGESTED by Reshy: A minor request but is it possible to change the way that AI pursues retreating ships so that they go to where the ship wants to be (the edge of their side of the map) rather than chasing them to their current location as they're actively moving away.  Basically, something to help the AI know to cut off fleeing ships.

SUGGESTED by TheShear:
The funny Luddic explosive Tankers loses its suicidal behavior
Standard behavior is: Once they get in range they usually press the button, charge in and explode.
What they are doing? Get in range with their guns and get slaughtered or even retreat.
I have the same behavior with the current release version of Tweaks

----------------------------------------------------------------

- vent module resets backoff distance on target change ???

- nova backing off too far to vent
    - probably missileDangerDir

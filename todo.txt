ships avoid collisions with very large modded shields

why invictus close to station? maybe admiral AI gave eliminate order?

----------------------------------------------------------------

- attack enemy ships that are inflicting damage

- sometimes guided finisher missiles are ignored when venting, especially on phase ships

- ships with assignment should have priority, at least for player fleet.

- area targeting for devastator

- don't prevent venting if target has more health than the ship

- REPORTED: vanilla ai fleets gathering in the middle of the map, on maps with no objectives

- do not track targets with angular velocity higher than weapon rotation

- avoid blocking burn vector via collision avoidance

- revisit hiding behind allies to vent

- extract vanilla missile decisioning

SUGGESTED: okay, I do have one question. there doesn't seem to be a way to unselect this without hitting the "reset mod to default" button, so adding a button that says fearless (default) or something might be handy.
Will it override the behavior of AI cores or ships that have other personalities? Like the Proxy Dustkeepers

REPORTED: Yeah, I console command in 2 lg sunder to test and I canâ€™t equip the other one [with custom AI]

drop the "frame-perfect" description from readme

----------------------------------------------------------------

- use front facing turrets with rotation speed lower than ship turn rate as hardpoints
 - unless flamed out
 - not for player

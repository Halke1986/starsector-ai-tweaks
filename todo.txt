ships avoid collisions with very large modded shields

----------------------------------------------------------------

why invictus close to station? maybe admiral AI gave eliminate order?

----------------------------------------------------------------

- attack enemy ships that are inflicting damage

- sometimes guided finisher missiles are ignored when venting, especially on phase ships

- autofire weapons should prioritize targets of other ships, maybe

- ships with assignment should have priority, at least for player fleet.

- don't care about frigates when rotating to burn

- area targeting for devastator

- 1v1 strafing, maybe use zero threat vector?

- IX paragon stays at spawn

- use front facing turrets with rotation speed lower than ship turn rate as hardpoints

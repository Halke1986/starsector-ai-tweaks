ships avoid collisions with very large modded shields

why invictus close to station? maybe admiral AI gave eliminate order?

----------------------------------------------------------------

- autofire weapons should prioritize targets of other ships, maybe

----------------------------------------------------------------

- attack enemy ships that are inflicting damage

- sometimes guided finisher missiles are ignored when venting, especially on phase ships

- ships with assignment should have priority, at least for player fleet.

- area targeting for devastator

- use front facing turrets with rotation speed lower than ship turn rate as hardpoints
 - unless flamed out
 - not for player

- don't prevent venting if target has more health than the ship

- REPORTED: vanilla ai fleets gathering in the middle of the map, on maps with no objectives

- do not track targets with angular velocity higher than weapon rotation

- calculate weapon range correctly for broadside weapon groups

vinh:
Btw genir, I have a suggestion in ai tweak. When equipping rce or vpd, maybe make the AI think it have 800 range weapon instead of 1000 range but still make be able to fire at max range. I uhh kinda want that since both weapon have lower dps at max range, I want them to move a bit closer to fire instead of hovering at max range and get half the dps. I am no good at coding so I donâ€™t know if this is feasible, just hope you look into it
Rift cascade and volatile particle driver

- avoid blocking burn vector via collision avoidance

- revisit hiding behind allies to vent

- extract vanilla missile decisioning

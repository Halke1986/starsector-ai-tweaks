SUGGESTED: ships avoid collisions with very large modded shields

----------------------------------------------------------------

- attack enemy ships that are inflicting damage

- sometimes guided finisher missiles are ignored when venting, especially on phase ships

- ships with assignment should have priority, at least for player fleet.

- area targeting for devastator

- REPORTED: vanilla ai fleets gathering in the middle of the map, on maps with no objectives

- do not track targets with angular velocity higher than weapon rotation

- avoid blocking burn vector via collision avoidance

- revisit hiding behind allies to vent

- extract vanilla missile decisioning

- drop the "frame-perfect" description from readme

- take damage type into account when calculating history of calculated damage, to not ignore hellbores when venting

- aim slow turrets
- DEPRECATED: use front facing turrets with rotation speed lower than ship turn rate as hardpoints
 - unless flamed out
 - not for player

- try to attack same enemy battle group during initial split

- notify systems of overridden facing in extended AI

- nova rotating when potential target in front

check Lidar on faster ships - destroyer : ass pinetree, frigate DEX Catapult

- automatic front shields?

- why SO ships backing off so far away
- nova backing off too far to vent
    - probably missileDangerDir

- nova hardpoints (hil) targeting fighters?

- Unify "$\ " keys!

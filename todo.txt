From what I observed, the Invictus custom AI target selection simply ignores the eliminate command; It seems to have a
strong bias towards whatever is the nearest to them which usually ends up in the ship trying to shoot frigates and
destroyers while getting blasted by the enemy capital right in front of them.

Even worse cases are the Invictus doing a 180 and showing their rear towards the eliminate target.
Also it seems that the custom AI knows where the enemies are even if none are in in-combat sensor range.

The fleet cohesion mechanic needs work. Whenever a ship gets separated in a fight, it will keep running straight back
just like vanilla AI would. You still have to make it move sideways using an order, otherwise it only stops at the edge
of the map.

why invictus close to station? maybe admiral AI gave eliminate order?


use vanilla keymap for auto omni shield
omni shield up not working in some cases

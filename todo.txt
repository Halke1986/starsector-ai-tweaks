SUGGESTED: ships avoid collisions with very large modded shields

----------------------------------------------------------------

- attack enemy ships that are inflicting damage

- sometimes guided finisher missiles are ignored when venting, especially on phase ships

- ships with assignment should have priority, at least for player fleet.

- area targeting for devastator

- REPORTED: vanilla ai fleets gathering in the middle of the map, on maps with no objectives

- do not track targets with angular velocity higher than weapon rotation

- avoid blocking burn vector via collision avoidance

- revisit hiding behind allies to vent

- extract vanilla missile decisioning

- drop the "frame-perfect" description from readme

- take damage type into account when calculating history of calculated damage, to not ignore hellbores when venting

- aim slow turrets
- DEPRECATED: use front facing turrets with rotation speed lower than ship turn rate as hardpoints
 - unless flamed out
 - not for player

- try to attack same enemy battle group during initial split

- notify systems of overridden facing in extended AI

- nova backing off too far to vent
    - probably missileDangerDir

- nova rotating when potential target in front

check Lidar on faster ships - destroyer : ass pinetree, frigate DEX Catapult

- automatic front shields?

- why SO ships backing off so far away

SUGGESTED by Roxorium: Speaking of which, @Genir would it be possible to add "ignore wrecks and asteroids" toggle?

SUGGESTED by vinh: Oh btw genir, remember the not making needlee firing againdt hull feature? Can you make it so that minipulse and vpd also do this?

SUGGESTED by TheShear:
The funny Luddic explosive Tankers loses its suicidal behavior
Standard behavior is: Once they get in range they usually press the button, charge in and explode.
What they are doing? Get in range with their guns and get slaughtered or even retreat.
I have the same behavior with the current release version of Tweaks
